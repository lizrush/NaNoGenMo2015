We're coming up on the end of November, which means apiring writers all over the world are frantically typing away in an attempt to write an entire novel in one month as part of National Novel Writing Month, also known as NaNoWriMo. Each Novemember, participants aim to write 50,000 words on a 30 day deadline--a difficult feat for any writer! NaNoWriMo has been around for quite a long time, but for the last couple of years programmers and digital artists have been participating in a cheeky alternative: [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015), or National Novel Generation Month.

Internet artist Darius Kazemi started NaNoGenMo after tweeting the idea in 2013:

This November is the third organized installment of NaNoGenMo and the community keeps growing every year as mor and more programmers & artists become interested in the strange intersection of tech, language processing, and literature. And because the event is primarily driven by developers, submissions are posted on a Github repo as Issues so that participants can comment on one another's ideas and help each other create some of the most unique and sometimes nonsensical novels written in November. 

In the NaNoGenMo world, "novel" is pretty loosely defined. According to the rules, 

> "The “novel” is defined however you want. It could be 50,000 repetitions of the word “meow”. It could literally grab a random novel from Project Gutenberg. It doesn’t matter, as long as it’s 50k+ words." 

(And of course, someone *did* make that [50,000 word "meow" book](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/issues/50) in 2014!)

Novel generation can be much more complicated than it appears from the outside. [Some books](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/issues/51) integrate with social media by pulling text from twitter to generate dialogue, [others](https://github.com/samcoppini/Definition-book) go down a recursive rabbithole, and some even generate [graphic novels](http://gregborenstein.com/comics/generated_detective/1/). 

Here at Algorithmia, we have a wide variety of algorithms that are a perfect fit for NaNoGenMo. Because I don't have any background in natural language processing or computational linguistics, I found it was easy to combine algorithms to not only help me generate my novel, but gain insights on the texts I used as a basis and the result.
